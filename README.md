# Antibody-and-antiviral-deployment

This is the code and configuration for an OpenSAFELY analysis of antibody and antiviral deployment via NHS COVID-19 Medicine Delivery Units. An accompanying pre-print [_Trends, regional variation and clinical characteristics of recipients of antivirals and neutralising monoclonal antibodies for non-hospitalised COVID-19: a descriptive cohort study of 23.4 million people in OpenSAFELY_ is available on MedRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.07.22272026).

* The protocol is available on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/sfpba/).
* Raw analysis outputs, including charts, crosstabs, etc, are published [here](https://jobs.opensafely.org/datalab/antibody-and-antiviral-deployment/mabs-main/outputs/).
* If you are interested in how we defined our variables, take a look at the [study definition](analysis/study_definition.py); this is written in `python`, but non-programmers should be able to understand what is going on there
* If you are interested in how we defined our code lists, look in the [codelists folder](./codelists/).
* Developers and epidemiologists interested in the framework should review [the OpenSAFELY documentation](https://docs.opensafely.org)
